# Dart Reduce Method Error on Empty List

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart when using the `reduce` method on an empty list. The `reduce` method requires at least one element in the list; otherwise, it throws an error.  This example shows the error and how to handle it gracefully by adding a check for an empty list before calling `reduce`.
